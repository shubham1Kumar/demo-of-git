# VCS ( Version Control System ) : are of two types :

1. **Centralized VCS**
2. **Distributed VCS**

* **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) :**  
In a Centralized VCS, all changes are made to a single central location, known as the “server”. All users work on a local copy of the project, and when they want to share their changes, they commit them to the central server. This type of system is often used in large organizations where a single, authoritative version of the project is needed.

* **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) :**   In a Distributed VCS, each developer has a local copy of the entire project, and changes are made to this local copy. When changes are committed, they are sent to a central server, but the server is not the only location where the project is stored. This type of system is often used in collaborative projects where multiple developers need to work on the same project simultaneously.
